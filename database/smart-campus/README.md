# Smart Campus

CityGML Data for Smart Campus is obtained from 3 layers of shapefile data:
1. RoofSurfaces were digitized using 3D Stereo Photogrammetry Software using some Aerail UAV Images
2. FloorPlans were digitized from CAD FloorPlan Drawing
3. DSM from SfM Photogrammetry process using same aerial UAV Images in no.1

We use Summit Photogrametric , Agisoft PhotoSCan, QGIS and Saga-GIS.

The pipe line process could be seen below:
